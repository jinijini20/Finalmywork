Change the style of landmarks
Select platform: Android [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/cloud-customization/landmarks] iOS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/cloud-customization/landmarks] JavaScript [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/landmarks] Web Service [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/cloud-customization/landmarks]
Availability: This feature is visible on Android, iOS, Maps JavaScript API, and Maps Static.
Landmarks and prominent places can have their own icons. You can choose from two different icon types to represent these types of places: Standard POI icons are similar in appearance to other map place markers; Illustrated POI icons feature a more distinctive appearance.
Experimental: This feature can only be set for light map styles. When you link a light map style that has custom landmark styles to a map ID, these styles also apply to the dark map style.
To change the landmark icon style, perform the following steps:
Zoom in on the map enough to see landmarks shown. For example, zoom in to Paris with a zoom level of 13.
In Map features, select the gear icon to open the Settings pane.
Select the Standard landmark style to display standard POI icons:
Select the Illustrated landmark style to display distinctive POI icons:
Note: When you enable illustrated icons, landmark POI icons replace the POIs that have an associated illustrated icon. When you disable illustrated icons, the illustrated icons revert back to the original feature type of that POI.
Open the Landmark element pane by using the filter or the map inspector. For more information, see Find map features [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/map-styles].
In the Landmark element pane, you can customize the visibility, icon color, text fill color, and text stroke color.
