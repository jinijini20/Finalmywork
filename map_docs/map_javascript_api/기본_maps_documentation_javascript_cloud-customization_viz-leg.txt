Filter which map features to display
Select platform: Android [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/cloud-customization/viz] iOS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/cloud-customization/viz] JavaScript [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/viz] Web Service [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/cloud-customization/viz]
You can filter which specific map features to display by adjusting their visibility. If you want to control how dense all POIs are on the map, see Control the density of Points of interest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/poi-behavior-customization].
You customize which points of interest on a map to display by setting the visibility for a map feature:
In the style editor, select the POI map feature you want to display or hide. For example, Points of interest > Lodging.
Under Visibility, the visibility is controlled by an eye icon visibility toggle. Select the eye icon to enable visibility selection, which turns the icon blue. The default basemap visibility is shown in gray.
Select the icon again to toggle the visibility between off and on.
On: Always display this map feature, when the zoom level allows.
Off: Never display this map feature.
Note: When you hide map features, you may expose boundary inaccuracies. Map feature boundaries are not always precise, but are adjusted to look correct when all layers are visible. To learn more about how map layers affect each other, see Manage styles that overlap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/overlap].
