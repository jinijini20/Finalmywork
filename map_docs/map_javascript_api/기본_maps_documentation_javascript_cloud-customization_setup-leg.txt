Get started and set up
Select platform: Android [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/cloud-customization/setup] iOS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/cloud-customization/setup] JavaScript [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/setup] Web Service [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/cloud-customization/setup]
Billing
Using cloud-based maps styling requires a map ID [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/get-map-id]. On Maps SDK for Android, Maps SDK for iOS, and JavaScript, using a map ID incurs a charge against the Dynamic Maps SKU [https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/sku-details#dynamic-maps-ess-sku]. On the Maps Static API, using a map ID incurs a charge against the Static Maps [https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/sku-details#static-maps-ess-sku] SKU.
