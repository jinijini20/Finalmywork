How deprecation works
Deprecation in SDK versions
Active deprecations
45° Imagery (Deprecated as of May 27, 2025)
Heatmap Layer (Deprecated as of May 27, 2025)
Maps SDK for Android legacy renderer (Deprecated as of March 4, 2024)
Maps SDK for iOS: setMetalRendererEnabled (As of v9.0.0)
google.maps.Marker in the Maps JavaScript API (Deprecated as of February 2024)
This page lists all Google Maps Platform products and features which are currently in a deprecation period. This includes products under Maps, Routes, and Places.
How deprecation works
The deprecation period for a product, feature, or version begins on the announcement date for the deprecation. The product, feature, or version will continue to be available throughout the deprecation period (typically 12 months). Once the deprecation period has elapsed, the product, feature, or version is expected to be decommissioned, and will no longer be available.
Project Owners with monitored email addresses receive proactive notifications about changes that impact each of their projects. Stay informed [https://developers.google.com/maps/support#staying_informed] about major updates, deprecations, and other changes.
Key Term: Deprecated indicates that the product or feature should no longer be used. Reasons for this may include:
A better alternative is available.
The product or feature is nearing or at end of support.
The product or feature is scheduled for decommissioning.
Key Term: Decommissioned indicates that the product or feature is no longer available. Calling decommissioned software can result in unpredictable behavior or invalid responses.
Deprecation in SDK versions
In SDKs and the Maps JavaScript API, feature deprecations are tied to version availability. New major versions declare breaking changes including feature deprecations and release notes indicate the maximum supporting version of each deprecated feature. You can continue to use the deprecated feature for as long as its maximum supporting SDK version is available. To upgrade to the next major version of the SDK, you must remove use of the deprecated feature from your code or migrate to its replacement.
Learn more about Maps JavaScript API version availability [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions], which follows a quarterly release and decommissioning schedule.
See guidance on managing version dependencies with the Maps SDK for Android [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/versions], Maps SDK for iOS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/versions], Places SDK for Android [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/versions], and Places SDK for iOS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/versions].
Active deprecations
This section lists all products and features which are currently in a deprecation period.
45° Imagery (Deprecated as of May 27, 2025)
As of version 3.62, Maps JavaScript API satellite and hybrid map types will no longer automatically switch to 45° Imagery at higher zoom levels. Where 45° Imagery is available, the map will show the top-down satellite view even as the user zooms in. Calls to map.setTilt(45) will also be ineffective. Customers and applications relying on 45° Imagery for their use-cases will be impacted and will need to switch to using alternatives, for example 3D maps [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3d/overview].
Heatmap Layer (Deprecated as of May 27, 2025)
The Heatmap Layer functionality in the Maps JavaScript API will no longer be supported due to low customer usage. This API was deprecated in May 2025 and will be made unavailable in a later version of the Maps JavaScript API, releasing in May 2026.
Applications currently using the Heatmap Layer to display heatmaps based on data points will need to be updated.
As a replacement for the Heatmap Layer, consider using third-party library integrations like deck.gl, which offers a HeatmapLayer implementation. You can find more information in the deck.gl documentation [https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/aggregation-layers/heatmap-layer].
Maps SDK for Android legacy renderer (Deprecated as of March 4, 2024)
To provide an improved user experience and app performance, apps built with the Maps SDK for Android have been automatically updated to the latest renderer [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/renderer]. The legacy renderer is deprecated and is scheduled for decommissioning in April 2025. Follow the decommissioning progress in public issue 404999856 [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/404999856].
Maps SDK for iOS: setMetalRendererEnabled (As of v9.0.0)
Since Apple has deprecated OpenGL support as of iOS 12 (2018), support for the OpenGL renderer and the setMetalRendererEnabled boolean in the Maps SDK for iOS is deprecated as of v9.0.0 , and will be unsupported in the major version that will be released in the second quarter of 2025.
Instead, use the Metal renderer, which has been default since Maps SDK for iOS v8.0.0, and remove setMetalRendererEnabled from your codebase.
google.maps.Marker in the Maps JavaScript API (Deprecated as of February 2024)
Advanced Markers (google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement) are better than google.maps.Marker in almost every way: easier to use, more performant, more accessible, more feature-rich, and more customizable. google.maps.Marker in the Maps JavaScript API is deprecated as of 3.56.
What do I need to do? Instead, use google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/advanced-markers/migration]. The minimum version of the Maps JavaScript API with google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement is 3.53.2. At this time, google.maps.Marker is not scheduled to be discontinued, but google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement is recommended over google.maps.Marker. While google.maps.Marker will continue to receive bug fixes for any major regressions, existing bugs in google.maps.Marker won't be addressed. At least 12 months notice will be given before support is discontinued.
GoogleMapsM4B SDK (Deprecated as of February 2024)
To streamline the SDK, the obsolete GoogleMapsM4B module in the Maps SDK for iOS is deprecated as of February 2024, and will be unsupported in the major version that will be released in the second quarter of 2025.
Since the GoogleMapsM4B module is related to an obsolete billing plan, it is safe to remove dependencies on the legacy GoogleMapsM4B module in your app. If you use CocoaPods to install the Maps SDK for iOS, remove the GoogleMapsM4B pod from the list of dependencies in your Podfile. If you manually install the Maps SDK for iOS, remove the GoogleMapsM4B framework from your project.
Bounds, location, and radius in the Maps JavaScript API Place Autocomplete Service (Deprecated as of May 2023)
For the Place Autocomplete Service in the Maps JavaScript API, the following request options are deprecated as of May 2023: bounds, location, and radius. Use locationBias and locationRestriction instead.
The feature will continue to work, and 12 months notice will be given before support is discontinued.
Places compatibility library for Places SDK for Android (As of March 31, 2022)
All versions of the Places compatibility library for Places SDK for Android are deprecated as of March 31, 2022. We are freezing development of the Places compatibility library on Places SDK for Android v2.6.0 (specified in dependencies as com.google.android.libraries.places:places-compat:2.6.0).
No new versions of this library will be released after this date. The only way to access features and bug fixes in Places SDK for Android above Version 2.6.0 will be to use the Places SDK for Android.
The Places compatibility library was introduced in January 2019 to facilitate the migration from the legacy SDK (available in Play Services) to the standalone Places SDK for Android.
Follow the migration guide [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/client-migration] to use the Places SDK for Android directly. Some status codes, method names, and Autocomplete class names are different between the Places compatibility library and the Places SDK for Android. See the Versions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/versions] documentation for specifying and maintaining dependencies on versions of the Places SDK for Android.
There is no plan to decommission the Places compatibility library at this time. However, if you choose to continue using available versions of the Places compatibility library, note the limitations on supporting old versions of an SDK [https://developers.google.com/maps/software-support#sdk-support].
Content Security Policy update (March 21, 2022 - May 2023)
Support for websites using Content Security Policy (CSP) [https://csp.withgoogle.com/] that don't specify googleapis.com in the Maps JavaScript API is deprecated as of v3.49, and will be unsupported beginning with v3.50. The last supporting version, v3.49, will be decommissioned in Q2 2023 after which the Maps JavaScript API will reject all requests using CSP directives that don't specify googleapis.com.
To avoid disruption of your website experience, specify googleapis.com in your CSP [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/content-security-policy]. All currently available versions of the Maps JavaScript API support CSP.
Places SDK for iOS `GMSPlaceField` now uses the `NS_OPTIONS` macro (As of v4.0.0)
Starting with Places SDK for iOS v4.0.0 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/releases#2020-10-13], GMSPlaceField now uses the NS_OPTIONS macro instead of NS_ENUM for better Swift support. Read more about Migrating to GMSPlaceField as NS_OPTIONS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/migrate-nsoptions].
To continue using GMSPlaceField as NS_ENUM, specify v3.10.0 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/releases#2020-08-10] or earlier in your dependencies [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/versions#installation].

These methods will continue to work and there is no plan to decommission them.
Completed deprecations
This section lists all products and features which have been decommissioned. These products and features are no longer available.
Local Context Library, Maps JavaScript API (Deprecated as of v3.51.2)
Due to the limited adoption of this beta feature, Local Context Library was discontinued in January 2024.
If you are interested in building a Local Context Library-like experience yourself, we suggest that you check out the "Neighborhood Discovery" solution in Quick Builder [https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/quick-builder/] or use the Places Library [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places], Maps JavaScript API. Code samples [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples#places] and codelabs [https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?product=googlemapsplatform&text=places] for the Places Library can help you.
Legacy cloud-based maps styling (March 18, 2024 - March 25, 2025)
On March 25, 2025 the legacy map styles automatically migrated to the next-generation of cloud-based maps styling. Some styling changes may result from this automatic migration.
See Update a map style to the latest version [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/update-legacy] to avoid any disruption in your map styles.
Google Maps Platform gaming services (October 18, 2021 - December 31, 2022)

Places SDKs for Android and iOS (January 29, 2019 - July 29, 2019)
Effective January 29, 2019, the upgraded Places SDKs for Android and iOS replaced the existing versions of the Places SDKs. The current versions of the Places SDK for iOS, the Places SDK for Android, and the Place Picker, were deprecated as of January 29, 2019, and were turned off on July 29, 2019.
Update to the latest Places SDK for iOS version [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/client-migration].
Update to the latest Places SDK for Android version [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/client-migration].
The Place Picker is no longer available as of July 29, 2019.
Place Add and Place Delete (June 30, 2017 - June 30, 2018)
Effective June 30, 2018, the Place Add and Place Delete features have been turned off, and are no longer available.
Unsupported Place Search queries in the Places API and Places Library, Maps JavaScript API (March 31, 2022 - March 31, 2023)
Unsupported Place Search queries for Text Search, Nearby Search, and Find Place in the Places API and Places Library, Maps JavaScript API are deprecated as of March 31, 2022 and will receive INVALID_REQUEST error responses beginning on March 31, 2023.
The Places API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service] and Places Library, Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places] support three methods to find places: Text Search [https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search-text], Nearby Search [https://developers.google.com/documentation/places/web-service/search-nearby], and Find Place [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search-find-place]. Each method accepts requests with supported combinations of parameters, and rejects most requests with combinations of parameters that are not supported.
A few combinations of unsupported parameters have not been properly rejected to date:
Text Search requests with an empty or missing query parameter and without a supported type parameter.
Text Search requests with query=*.
Nearby Search requests with keyword=*.
Nearby Search requests with name=*.
Find Place requests with input=*.
These unsupported Place Search requests must be replaced with one of the following:
Nearby Search [https://developers.google.com/documentation/places/web-service/search-nearby] requests without the keyword (or name) parameter can be used to find nearby establishments. It is recommended to also use the type parameter with one supported type (see Table 1: Place types [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table1]). This provides the closest match to the current behavior of Text Search requests with an empty or missing query parameter.
Geocoding API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/requests-reverse-geocoding] requests with the latlng parameter can be used to find the nearest addresses. This provides the closest match to the current behavior of:
Text Search requests with query=*.
Nearby Search requests with keyword=*.
Nearby Search requests with name=*.
Find Place requests with input=*.
