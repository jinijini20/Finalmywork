Understand your bill
The Billing [https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing] reports page is a reporting feature in the Google Cloud console. It provides customizable analysis of your past and current expenditures on Google Maps Platform and Google Cloud, as well as the tools necessary to understand your charges and reconcile your bill.
Cloud Billing Reports can help you answer any of the following questions:
How does my current month's spend compare to last month's?
What Google Maps service is responsible for the most spend?
How much am I spending in a particular region?
How much am I saving from committed use discounts, and could I save more?

Committed use discounts (CUD) analysis reports

Interactive tutorial: Analyze billing data with BigQuery (20 minutes)
Get started with billing data exports using this interactive tutorial. In the tutorial, you'll enable Cloud Billing data to export to a BigQuery dataset. Next, you'll run some sample queries through the BigQuery web interface to examine billing data.
Launch the billing data export tutorial [https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?walkthrough_tutorial_id=billing_bigquery_export]
You can set up custom reporting based on your exported billing data using BigQuery. To do this, you must enable the Cloud Billing export to BigQuery [https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery#setup] service, which automatically uploads your data to a BigQuery dataset.
Once your data is in BigQuery, you can run queries against it, or use tools like Looker Studio to create custom visualizations.
