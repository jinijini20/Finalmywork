GMSAddressComponent
GMSAutocompleteFetcher
GMSAutocompleteFilter
GMSAutocompleteMatchFragment
GMSAutocompletePlaceSuggestion
Classes
The following classes are available globally.
GMSAddressComponent
Represents a component of an address, e.g., street number, postcode, city, etc.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAddressComponent : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAddressComponent : NSObject
GMSAutocompleteFetcher
GMSAutocompleteFetcher is a wrapper around the lower-level autocomplete APIs that encapsulates some of the complexity of requesting autocomplete predictions as the user is typing. Calling sourceTextHasChanged will generally result in the provided delegate being called with autocomplete predictions for the queried text, with the following provisos:
The fetcher may not necessarily request predictions on every call of sourceTextHasChanged if several requests are made within a short amount of time.
The delegate will only be called with prediction results if those predictions are for the text supplied in the most recent call to sourceTextHasChanged.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteFetcher : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteFetcher : NSObject
GMSAutocompleteFilter
This class represents a set of restrictions that may be applied to autocomplete requests. This allows customization of autocomplete suggestions to only those places that are of interest.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteFilter : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteFilter : NSObject
GMSAutocompleteMatchFragment
This class represents a matched fragment of a string. This is a contiguous range of characters in a string, suitable for highlighting in an autocompletion UI.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteMatchFragment : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteMatchFragment : NSObject
GMSAutocompletePlaceSuggestion
This class represents a place suggestion of a full query based on a partially typed string.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompletePlaceSuggestion : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompletePlaceSuggestion : NSObject
GMSAutocompletePrediction
This class represents a prediction of a full query based on a partially typed string.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompletePrediction : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompletePrediction : NSObject
GMSAutocompleteRequest
The request for autocomplete data.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteRequest : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteRequest : NSObject
GMSAutocompleteResultsViewController
GMSAutocompleteResultsViewController provides an interface that displays place autocomplete predictions in a table view. The table view will be automatically updated as input text changes.
This class is intended to be used as the search results controller of a UISearchController. Pass an instance of GMSAutocompleteResultsViewController to UISearchController’s initWithSearchResultsController method, then set the controller as the UISearchController’s searchResultsUpdater property.
Use the GMSAutocompleteResultsViewControllerDelegate delegate protocol to be notified when a place is selected from the list.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteResultsViewController : UIViewController, UISearchResultsUpdating
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteResultsViewController
    : UIViewController <UISearchResultsUpdating>
GMSAutocompleteSessionToken
This class represents a session token to uniquely identify a series of queries to the Google Places API Services for fetching place predictions for a partial search string.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteSessionToken : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteSessionToken : NSObject
GMSAutocompleteSuggestion
This class represents a suggestion of a full query based on a partially typed string.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteSuggestion : NSObject
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteSuggestion : NSObject
GMSAutocompleteTableDataSource
GMSAutocompleteTableDataSource provides an interface for providing place autocomplete predictions to populate a UITableView by implementing the UITableViewDataSource and UITableViewDelegate protocols.
GMSAutocompleteTableDataSource is designed to be used as the data source for a UISearchDisplayController.
NOTE: UISearchDisplayController has been deprecated since iOS 8. It is now recommended to use UISearchController with GMSAutocompleteResultsViewController to display autocomplete results using the iOS search UI.
Set an instance of GMSAutocompleteTableDataSource as the searchResultsDataSource and searchResultsDelegate properties of UISearchDisplayController. In your implementation of shouldReloadTableForSearchString, call sourceTextHasChanged with the current search string.
Use the GMSAutocompleteTableDataSourceDelegate delegate protocol to be notified when a place is selected from the list. Because autocomplete predictions load asynchronously, it is necessary to implement didUpdateAutocompletePredictions and call reloadData on the UISearchDisplayController‘s table view.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteTableDataSource : NSObject, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteTableDataSource
    : NSObject <UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate>
GMSAutocompleteViewController
GMSAutocompleteViewController provides an interface that displays a table of autocomplete predictions that updates as the user enters text. Place selections made by the user are returned to the app via the GMSAutocompleteViewControllerResultsDelegate protocol.
To use GMSAutocompleteViewController, set its delegate to an object in your app that conforms to the GMSAutocompleteViewControllerDelegate protocol and present the controller (eg using presentViewController). The GMSAutocompleteViewControllerDelegate delegate methods can be used to determine when the user has selected a place or has cancelled selection.
Declaration
SWIFT
class GMSAutocompleteViewController : UIViewController
OBJECTIVE-C
@interface GMSAutocompleteViewController : UIViewController
