DrawingManager [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/drawing#DrawingManager]
class

google.maps.drawing.DrawingManager
class

Allows users to draw markers, polygons, polylines, rectangles, and circles on the map. The DrawingManager's drawing mode defines the type of overlay that will be created by the user. Adds a control to the map, allowing the user to switch drawing mode.
This class extends
MVCObject [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/event#MVCObject].

Access by calling const {DrawingManager} = await google.maps.importLibrary("drawing"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constructor |
| --- |
| DrawingManager | DrawingManager([options]) Parameters:  options:  DrawingManagerOptions optional Creates a DrawingManager that allows users to draw overlays on the map, and switch between the type of overlay to be drawn with a drawing control. |
| Methods |
| --- |
| getDrawingMode | getDrawingMode() Parameters:  None Return Value:  OverlayType\|null Returns the DrawingManager's drawing mode. |
| getMap | getMap() Parameters:  None Return Value:  Map Returns the Map to which the DrawingManager is attached, which is the Map on which the overlays created will be placed. |
| setDrawingMode | setDrawingMode(drawingMode) Parameters:  drawingMode:  OverlayType optional Return Value:  None Changes the DrawingManager's drawing mode, which defines the type of overlay to be added on the map. Accepted values are 'marker', 'polygon', 'polyline', 'rectangle', 'circle', or null. A drawing mode of null means that the user can interact with the map as normal, and clicks do not draw anything. |
| setMap | setMap(map) Parameters:  map:  Map Return Value:  None Attaches the DrawingManager object to the specified Map. |
| setOptions | setOptions(options) Parameters:  options:  DrawingManagerOptions Return Value:  None Sets the DrawingManager's options. |
| Inherited: addListener, bindTo, get, notify, set, setValues, unbind, unbindAll |
| Events |
| --- |
| circlecomplete | function(circle) Arguments:  circle:  Circle The circle that the user has just drawn. This event is fired when the user has finished drawing a circle. |
| markercomplete | function(marker) Arguments:  marker:  Marker The marker that the user has just drawn. This event is fired when the user has finished drawing a marker. |
| overlaycomplete | function(event) Arguments:  event:  OverlayCompleteEvent The overlay that the user has just drawn, together with the type of the overlay. This event is fired when the user has finished drawing an overlay of any type. |
| polygoncomplete | function(polygon) Arguments:  polygon:  Polygon The polygon that the user has just drawn. This event is fired when the user has finished drawing a polygon. |
| polylinecomplete | function(polyline) Arguments:  polyline:  Polyline The polyline that the user has just drawn. This event is fired when the user has finished drawing a polyline. |
| rectanglecomplete | function(rectangle) Arguments:  rectangle:  Rectangle The rectangle that the user has just drawn. This event is fired when the user has finished drawing a rectangle. |
