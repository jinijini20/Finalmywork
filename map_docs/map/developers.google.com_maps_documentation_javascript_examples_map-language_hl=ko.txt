Localizing the Map

Stay organized with collections

This example creates a map that's localized in Japanese, regardless of the
user's browser settings. The region is also set to Japan, which biases the
geocoding results to that region.

Read the documentation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/localization].

/*
* Always set the map height explicitly to define the size of the div element
* that contains the map.
