LocationProvider [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/journey-sharing-map-view#LocationProvider]
abstract class

google.maps.journeySharing.LocationProvider
abstract class

Parent class of all location providers.
| Methods |
| --- |
| addListener | addListener(eventName, handler) Parameters:  eventName:  string The name of the event to listen for. handler:  Function The event handler. Return Value:  MapsEventListener Adds a MapsEventListener for an event fired by this location provider. Returns an identifier for this listener that can be used with event.removeListener. |

PollingLocationProvider [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/journey-sharing-map-view#PollingLocationProvider]
abstract class

google.maps.journeySharing.PollingLocationProvider
abstract class

Parent class of polling location providers.
This abstract class extends
LocationProvider [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/journey-sharing-map-view#LocationProvider].

| Properties |
| --- |
| isPolling | Type:  boolean True if this location provider is polling. Read only. |
| pollingIntervalMillis | Type:  number Minimum time between fetching location updates in milliseconds. If it takes longer than pollingIntervalMillis to fetch a location update, the next location update is not started until the current one finishes.  Setting this value to 0, Infinity, or a negative value disables automatic location updates. A new location update is fetched once if the tracking ID parameter (for example, the shipment tracking ID of the shipment location provider), or a filtering option (for example, viewport bounds or attribute filters for fleet location providers) changes.  The default, and minimum, polling interval is 5000 milliseconds. If you set the polling interval to a lower positive value, 5000 is stored and used. |

| Inherited: addListener |
| Events |

| ispollingchange | function(event) Arguments:  event:  PollingLocationProviderIsPollingChangeEvent Event that is triggered when the polling state of the location provider is updated. Use PollingLocationProvider.isPolling to determine the current polling state. |

interface

The event object passed to the event handler when the PollingLocationProvider.ispollingchange [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/journey-sharing-map-view#PollingLocationProvider.ispollingchange] event is triggered.
