As of February 21st, 2024 (v3.56), google.maps.Marker is deprecated. We encourage you to
transition to the new google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement class. Advanced
markers provide substantial improvements over the legacy google.maps.Marker class.
The minimum version of the Maps JavaScript API with google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement
is 3.53.2. At this time, google.maps.Marker is not scheduled to be discontinued.

This example creates five markers which are accessible. The first marker
receives focus when tab is pressed; you can then use the arrow keys to move
between markers. Press tab again to continue moving through the rest of the map
controls. If a marker has an info window, you can open it by clicking, or by
pressing the enter key or space bar. When the info window closes, focus will
return to the associated marker.

documentation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers#accessible].
