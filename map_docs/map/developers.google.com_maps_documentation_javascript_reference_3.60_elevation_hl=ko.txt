ElevationService [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#ElevationService]
class

google.maps.ElevationService
class

Defines a service class that talks directly to Google servers for requesting elevation data.
Access by calling const {ElevationService} = await google.maps.importLibrary("elevation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constructor |
| --- |
| ElevationService | ElevationService() Parameters:  None Creates a new instance of a ElevationService that sends elevation queries to Google servers. |
| Methods |
| --- |
| getElevationAlongPath | getElevationAlongPath(request[, callback]) Parameters:  request:  PathElevationRequest callback:  function(Array<ElevationResult> optional, ElevationStatus): void optional Return Value:  Promise<PathElevationResponse> Makes an elevation request along a path, where the elevation data are returned as distance-based samples along that path. |
| getElevationForLocations | getElevationForLocations(request[, callback]) Parameters:  request:  LocationElevationRequest callback:  function(Array<ElevationResult> optional, ElevationStatus): void optional Return Value:  Promise<LocationElevationResponse> Makes an elevation request for a list of discrete locations. |

LocationElevationRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#LocationElevationRequest]
interface

google.maps.LocationElevationRequest
interface

An elevation request sent by the ElevationService containing the list of discrete coordinates (LatLngs) for which to return elevation data.
| Properties |
| --- |
| locations optional | Type:  Array<LatLng\|LatLngLiteral> optional The discrete locations for which to retrieve elevations. |

LocationElevationResponse [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#LocationElevationResponse]
interface

google.maps.LocationElevationResponse
interface

An elevation response returned by the ElevationService [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#ElevationService] containing the list of ElevationResult [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#ElevationResult]s matching the locations of the LocationElevationRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#LocationElevationRequest].
| Properties |
| --- |
| results | Type:  Array<ElevationResult> The list of ElevationResults matching the locations of the LocationElevationRequest. |

PathElevationRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#PathElevationRequest]
interface

google.maps.PathElevationRequest
interface

An elevation query sent by the ElevationService containing the path along which to return sampled data. This request defines a continuous path along the earth along which elevation samples should be taken at evenly-spaced distances. All paths from vertex to vertex use segments of the great circle between those two points.
| Properties |
| --- |
| samples | Type:  number Required. The number of equidistant points along the given path for which to retrieve elevation data, including the endpoints. The number of samples must be a value between 2 and 512 inclusive. |
| path optional | Type:  Array<LatLng\|LatLngLiteral> optional The path along which to collect elevation values. |

PathElevationResponse [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#PathElevationResponse]
interface

google.maps.PathElevationResponse
interface

An elevation response returned by the ElevationService [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#ElevationService] containing the list of ElevationResult [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#ElevationResult]s evenly-spaced along the path of the PathElevationRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#PathElevationRequest].
| Properties |
| --- |
| results | Type:  Array<ElevationResult> The list of ElevationResults matching the samples of the PathElevationRequest. |

ElevationResult [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#ElevationResult]
interface

google.maps.ElevationResult
interface

The result of an ElevationService request, consisting of the set of elevation coordinates and their elevation values. Note that a single request may produce multiple ElevationResults.
| Properties |
| --- |
| elevation | Type:  number The elevation of this point on Earth, in meters above sea level. |
| resolution | Type:  number The distance, in meters, between sample points from which the elevation was interpolated. This property will be missing if the resolution is not known. Note that elevation data becomes more coarse (larger resolution values) when multiple points are passed. To obtain the most accurate elevation value for a point, it should be queried independently. |
| location optional | Type:  LatLng optional The location of this elevation result. |

ElevationStatus [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/elevation#ElevationStatus]
constants

google.maps.ElevationStatus
constants

The status returned by the ElevationService upon completion of an elevation request. Specify these by value, or by using the constant's name. For example, 'OK' or google.maps.ElevationStatus.OK.
Access by calling const {ElevationStatus} = await google.maps.importLibrary("elevation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |
| --- |
| INVALID_REQUEST | The request was invalid. |
| OK | The request did not encounter any errors. |
| OVER_QUERY_LIMIT | The webpage has gone over the requests limit in too short a period of time. |
| REQUEST_DENIED | The webpage is not allowed to use the elevation service. |
| UNKNOWN_ERROR | The elevation request could not be successfully processed, yet the exact reason for the failure is not known. |
