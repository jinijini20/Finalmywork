DistanceMatrixService [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/distance-matrix#DistanceMatrixService]
class

google.maps.DistanceMatrixService
class

A service for computing distances between multiple origins and destinations.
Access by calling const {DistanceMatrixService} = await google.maps.importLibrary("routes"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constructor |
| --- |
| DistanceMatrixService | DistanceMatrixService() Parameters:  None Creates a new instance of a DistanceMatrixService that sends distance matrix queries to Google servers. |
| Methods |
| --- |
| getDistanceMatrix | getDistanceMatrix(request[, callback]) Parameters:  request:  DistanceMatrixRequest callback:  function(DistanceMatrixResponse optional, DistanceMatrixStatus): void optional Return Value:  Promise<DistanceMatrixResponse> Issues a distance matrix request. |

DistanceMatrixRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/distance-matrix#DistanceMatrixRequest]
interface

google.maps.DistanceMatrixRequest
interface

A distance matrix query sent by the DistanceMatrixService containing arrays of origin and destination locations, and various options for computing metrics.
| Properties |
| --- |
| destinations | Type:  Array<string\|LatLng\|LatLngLiteral\|Place> An array containing destination address strings, or LatLng, or Place objects, to which to calculate distance and time. Required. |
| origins | Type:  Array<string\|LatLng\|LatLngLiteral\|Place> An array containing origin address strings, or LatLng, or Place objects, from which to calculate distance and time. Required. |
| travelMode | Type:  TravelMode Type of routing requested. Required. |
| avoidFerries optional | Type:  boolean optional If true, instructs the Distance Matrix service to avoid ferries where possible. Optional. |
| avoidHighways optional | Type:  boolean optional If true, instructs the Distance Matrix service to avoid highways where possible. Optional. |
| avoidTolls optional | Type:  boolean optional If true, instructs the Distance Matrix service to avoid toll roads where possible. Optional. |
| drivingOptions optional | Type:  DrivingOptions optional Settings that apply only to requests where travelMode is DRIVING. This object will have no effect for other travel modes. |
| language optional | Type:  string optional A language identifier for the language in which results should be returned, when possible. See the list of supported languages. |
| region optional | Type:  string optional Region code used as a bias for geocoding requests. The region code accepts a ccTLD ("top-level domain") two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"). |
| transitOptions optional | Type:  TransitOptions optional Settings that apply only to requests where travelMode is TRANSIT. This object will have no effect for other travel modes. |
| unitSystem optional | Type:  UnitSystem optional Preferred unit system to use when displaying distance. Optional; defaults to metric. |

DistanceMatrixResponse [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/distance-matrix#DistanceMatrixResponse]
interface

google.maps.DistanceMatrixResponse
interface

The response to a DistanceMatrixService request, consisting of the formatted origin and destination addresses, and a sequence of DistanceMatrixResponseRows, one for each corresponding origin address.
| Properties |
| --- |
| destinationAddresses | Type:  Array<string> The formatted destination addresses. |
| originAddresses | Type:  Array<string> The formatted origin addresses. |
| rows | Type:  Array<DistanceMatrixResponseRow> The rows of the matrix, corresponding to the origin addresses. |

DistanceMatrixResponseRow [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/distance-matrix#DistanceMatrixResponseRow]
interface

google.maps.DistanceMatrixResponseRow
interface

A row of the response to a DistanceMatrixService request, consisting of a sequence of DistanceMatrixResponseElements, one for each corresponding destination address.
| Properties |
| --- |
| elements | Type:  Array<DistanceMatrixResponseElement> The row's elements, corresponding to the destination addresses. |

DistanceMatrixResponseElement [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/distance-matrix#DistanceMatrixResponseElement]
interface

google.maps.DistanceMatrixResponseElement
interface

A single element of a response to a DistanceMatrixService request, which contains the duration and distance from one origin to one destination.
| Properties |
| --- |
| distance | Type:  Distance The distance for this origin-destination pairing. This property may be undefined as the distance may be unknown. |
| duration | Type:  Duration The duration for this origin-destination pairing. This property may be undefined as the duration may be unknown. |
| duration_in_traffic | Type:  Duration The duration for this origin-destination pairing, taking into account the traffic conditions indicated by the trafficModel property. This property may be undefined as the duration may be unknown. Only available to Premium Plan customers when drivingOptions is defined when making the request. |
| fare | Type:  TransitFare The total fare for this origin-destination pairing. Only applicable to transit requests. |
| status | Type:  DistanceMatrixElementStatus The status of this particular origin-destination pairing. |

DistanceMatrixStatus [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/distance-matrix#DistanceMatrixStatus]
constants

google.maps.DistanceMatrixStatus
constants

The top-level status about the request in general returned by the DistanceMatrixService upon completion of a distance matrix request. Specify these by value, or by using the constant's name. For example, 'OK' or google.maps.DistanceMatrixStatus.OK.
Access by calling const {DistanceMatrixStatus} = await google.maps.importLibrary("routes"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |
| --- |
| INVALID_REQUEST | The provided request was invalid. |
| MAX_DIMENSIONS_EXCEEDED | The request contains more than 25 origins, or more than 25 destinations. |
| MAX_ELEMENTS_EXCEEDED | The product of origins and destinations exceeds the per-query limit. |
| OK | The response contains a valid result. |
| OVER_QUERY_LIMIT | Too many elements have been requested within the allowed time period. The request should succeed if you try again after some time. |
| REQUEST_DENIED | The service denied use of the Distance Matrix service by your web page. |
| UNKNOWN_ERROR | A Distance Matrix request could not be processed due to a server error. The request may succeed if you try again. |

constants

google.maps.DistanceMatrixElementStatus
constants

The element-level status about a particular origin-destination pairing returned by the DistanceMatrixService upon completion of a distance matrix request. These values are specified as strings, for example, 'OK'.
Access by calling const {DistanceMatrixElementStatus} = await google.maps.importLibrary("routes"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |
| --- |
| NOT_FOUND | The origin and/or destination of this pairing could not be geocoded. |
| OK | The response contains a valid result. |
| ZERO_RESULTS | No route could be found between the origin and destination. |
