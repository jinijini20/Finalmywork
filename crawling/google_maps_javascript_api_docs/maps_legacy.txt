Legacy products and features
This topic lists all Google Maps Platform products and features that are currently, or scheduled to be, in the Legacy [https://developers.google.com/maps/launch-stages#legacy] stage.
How Legacy status works
Legacy is an intermediate lifecycle step to ease the transition between Generally Available services and Deprecated services.
Legacy-marked services will be officially feature frozen, and new feature requests will only be considered for updated non-Legacy services.
Legacy-marked services will retain full support.
Existing projects already using Legacy services can continue to do so.
While we envision that Legacy services will be turned down in the coming years, there is no date yet for when this will happen.
Subject to the Google Maps Platform Terms of Service [https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms] Deprecation Policy, we will provide at least a 12-month notice prior to the decommission of the services.
Active services with Legacy status
This section lists all products and features which are either Legacy or scheduled to be in Legacy.

LegacyApiNotActivatedMapError
Google throws this error when your application is querying a legacy API (Places API [https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview-legacy], Directions API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview], or Distance Matrix API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview]) that is not enabled on your project. In most cases, keep legacy APIs disabled on new projects.
If you own the application that's throwing this error, use the equivalent new API [https://developers.google.com/maps/legacy#active_services_with_legacy_status] instead.
If you don't own the application that's throwing this error, report this issue to your application provider by sharing this URL with them, and follow their instructions to upgrade to a new version. As a short-term solution, consider activating the legacy API(s):

Directions API [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/directions-backend.googleapis.com?utm_source=Docs_error_LegacyApiNotActivatedMapError]
