As of February 21st, 2024 (v3.56), google.maps.Marker is deprecated. We encourage you to
transition to the new google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement class. Advanced
markers provide substantial improvements over the legacy google.maps.Marker class.
The minimum version of the Maps JavaScript API with google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement
is 3.53.2. At this time, google.maps.Marker is not scheduled to be discontinued.

This example uses window.setTimeout() to place markers on the map
consecutively rather than all at once when a Drop Markers button is
clicked.

Read the documentation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers#animate].
