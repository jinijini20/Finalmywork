Geocoder [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/geocoder#Geocoder]
class

google.maps.Geocoder
class

A service for converting between an address and a LatLng.
Access by calling const {Geocoder} = await google.maps.importLibrary("geocoding"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constructor |
| --- |
| Geocoder | Geocoder() Parameters:  None Creates a new instance of a Geocoder that sends geocode requests to Google servers. |
| Methods |
| --- |
| geocode | geocode(request[, callback]) Parameters:  request:  GeocoderRequest callback:  function(Array<GeocoderResult> optional, GeocoderStatus): void optional Return Value:  Promise<GeocoderResponse> Geocode a request. |

GeocoderRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/geocoder#GeocoderRequest]
interface

google.maps.GeocoderRequest
interface

The specification for a geocoding request to be sent to the Geocoder.
| Properties |
| --- |
| address optional | Type:  string optional Address to geocode. One, and only one, of address, location and placeId must be supplied. |
| bounds optional | Type:  LatLngBounds\|LatLngBoundsLiteral optional LatLngBounds within which to search. Optional. |
| componentRestrictions optional | Type:  GeocoderComponentRestrictions optional Components are used to restrict results to a specific area. A filter consists of one or more of: route, locality, administrativeArea, postalCode, country. Only the results that match all the filters will be returned. Filter values support the same methods of spelling correction and partial matching as other geocoding requests. Optional. |
| extraComputations optional | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  Array<ExtraGeocodeComputation> optional A list of extra computations which may be used to complete the request. Note: These extra computations may return extra fields on the response. |
| fulfillOnZeroResults optional | Type:  boolean optional Fulfill the promise on a ZERO_RESULT status in the response. This may be desired because even with zero geocoding results there may still be additional response level fields returned. |
| language optional | Type:  string optional A language identifier for the language in which results should be returned, when possible. See the list of supported languages. |
| location optional | Type:  LatLng\|LatLngLiteral optional LatLng (or LatLngLiteral) for which to search. The geocoder performs a reverse geocode. See Reverse Geocoding for more information. One, and only one, of address, location and placeId must be supplied. |
| placeId optional | Type:  string optional The place ID associated with the location. Place IDs uniquely identify a place in the Google Places database and on Google Maps. Learn more about place IDs in the Places API developer guide. The geocoder performs a reverse geocode. See Reverse Geocoding for more information. One, and only one, of address, location and placeId must be supplied. |
| region optional | Type:  string optional Country code used to bias the search, specified as a two-character (non-numeric) Unicode region subtag / CLDR identifier. Optional. See Google Maps Platform Coverage Details for supported regions. |
