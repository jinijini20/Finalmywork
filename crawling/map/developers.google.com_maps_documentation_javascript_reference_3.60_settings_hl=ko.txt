class

google.maps.Settings

| Static Methods |
| --- |
| getInstance | getInstance() Parameters:  None Return Value:  Settings Returns the singleton instance of google.maps.Settings. |
| Properties |
| --- |
| experienceIds | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  Iterable<string> A collection of unique experience IDs to which to attribute Maps JS API calls. The returned value is a copy of the internal value that is stored in the Settings class singleton instance. Operations on google.maps.Settings.getInstance().experienceIds will therefore only modify the copy and not the internal value.  To update the internal value, set the property equal to the new value on the singleton instance (ex: google.maps.Settings.getInstance().experienceIds = [experienceId];). |
| fetchAppCheckToken | Type:  function(): Promise<MapsAppCheckTokenResult> Set this property to a function that returns a promise which resolves to a Firebase App Check token result. |
