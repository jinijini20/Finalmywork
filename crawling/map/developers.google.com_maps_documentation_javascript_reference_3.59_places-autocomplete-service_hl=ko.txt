| Properties |
| --- |
| input | Type:  string The user entered input string. |
| bounds optional | Deprecated: bounds is deprecated as of May 2023. Use AutocompletionRequest.locationBias and AutocompletionRequest.locationRestriction instead. Type:  LatLngBounds\|LatLngBoundsLiteral optional Bounds for prediction biasing. Predictions will be biased towards, but not restricted to, the given bounds. Both location and radius will be ignored if bounds is set. |
| componentRestrictions optional | Type:  ComponentRestrictions optional The component restrictions. Component restrictions are used to restrict predictions to only those within the parent component. For example, the country. |
| language optional | Type:  string optional A language identifier for the language in which the results should be returned, if possible. Results in the selected language may be given a higher ranking, but suggestions are not restricted to this language. See the list of supported languages. |
| location optional | Deprecated: location is deprecated as of May 2023. Use AutocompletionRequest.locationBias and AutocompletionRequest.locationRestriction instead. Type:  LatLng optional Location for prediction biasing. Predictions will be biased towards the given location and radius. Alternatively, bounds can be used. |
| locationBias optional | Type:  LocationBias optional A soft boundary or hint to use when searching for places. |
| locationRestriction optional | Type:  LocationRestriction optional Bounds to constrain search results. |
| offset optional | Type:  number optional The character position in the input term at which the service uses text for predictions (the position of the cursor in the input field). |
| origin optional | Type:  LatLng\|LatLngLiteral optional The location where AutocompletePrediction.distance_meters is calculated from. |
| radius optional | Deprecated: radius is deprecated as of May 2023. Use AutocompletionRequest.locationBias and AutocompletionRequest.locationRestriction instead. Type:  number optional The radius of the area used for prediction biasing. The radius is specified in meters, and must always be accompanied by a location property. Alternatively, bounds can be used. |
| region optional | Type:  string optional A region code which is used for result formatting and for result filtering. It does not restrict the suggestions to this country. The region code accepts a ccTLD ("top-level domain") two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"). |
| sessionToken optional | Type:  AutocompleteSessionToken optional Unique reference used to bundle individual requests into sessions. |
| types optional | Type:  Array<string> optional The types of predictions to be returned. For supported types, see the developer's guide. If no types are specified, all types will be returned. |
