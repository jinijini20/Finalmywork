KmlLayer [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/kml#KmlLayer]
class

google.maps.KmlLayer
class

A KmlLayer adds geographic markup to the map from a KML, KMZ or GeoRSS file that is hosted on a publicly accessible web server. A KmlFeatureData object is provided for each feature when clicked.
This class extends
MVCObject [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/event#MVCObject].

Access by calling const {KmlLayer} = await google.maps.importLibrary("maps"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constructor |
| --- |
| KmlLayer | KmlLayer([opts]) Parameters:  opts:  KmlLayerOptions optional Options for this layer. Creates a KmlLayer which renders the contents of the specified KML/KMZ file (https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference) or GeoRSS file (http://www.georss.org). |
| Methods |
| --- |
| getDefaultViewport | getDefaultViewport() Parameters:  None Return Value:  LatLngBounds Get the default viewport for the layer being displayed. |
| getMap | getMap() Parameters:  None Return Value:  Map Get the map on which the KML Layer is being rendered. |
| getMetadata | getMetadata() Parameters:  None Return Value:  KmlLayerMetadata Get the metadata associated with this layer, as specified in the layer markup. |
| getStatus | getStatus() Parameters:  None Return Value:  KmlLayerStatus Get the status of the layer, set once the requested document has loaded. |
| getUrl | getUrl() Parameters:  None Return Value:  string URL Gets the URL of the KML file being displayed. |
| getZIndex | getZIndex() Parameters:  None Return Value:  number The z-index. Gets the z-index of the KML Layer. |
| setMap | setMap(map) Parameters:  map:  Map Return Value:  None Renders the KML Layer on the specified map. If map is set to null, the layer is removed. |
| setOptions | setOptions(options) Parameters:  options:  KmlLayerOptions Return Value:  None |
| setUrl | setUrl(url) Parameters:  url:  string Return Value:  None Sets the URL of the KML file to display. |
| setZIndex | setZIndex(zIndex) Parameters:  zIndex:  number The z-index to set. Return Value:  None Sets the z-index of the KML Layer. |
| Inherited: addListener, bindTo, get, notify, set, setValues, unbind, unbindAll |
| Events |
| --- |
| click | function(kmlClickEvent) Arguments:  kmlClickEvent:  KmlMouseEvent This event is fired when a feature in the layer is clicked. |
| defaultviewport_changed | function() Arguments:  None This event is fired when the KML layers default viewport has changed. |
| status_changed | function() Arguments:  None This event is fired when the KML layer has finished loading. At this point it is safe to read the status property to determine if the layer loaded successfully. |
