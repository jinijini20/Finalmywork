| Properties |
| --- |
| directions optional | Type:  DirectionsResult optional The directions to display on the map and/or in a <div> panel, retrieved as a DirectionsResult object from DirectionsService. |
| draggable optional | Type:  boolean optional If true, allows the user to drag and modify the paths of routes rendered by this DirectionsRenderer. |

| infoWindow optional | Type:  InfoWindow optional The InfoWindow in which to render text information when a marker is clicked. Existing info window content will be overwritten and its position moved. If no info window is specified, the DirectionsRenderer will create and use its own info window. This property will be ignored if suppressInfoWindows is set to true. |
| map optional | Type:  Map optional Map on which to display the directions. |

DirectionsWaypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/directions#DirectionsWaypoint]
interface

google.maps.DirectionsWaypoint
interface

A DirectionsWaypoint represents a location between origin and destination through which the trip should be routed.
| Properties |
| --- |
| location optional | Type:  string\|LatLng\|LatLngLiteral\|Place optional Waypoint location. Can be an address string, a LatLng, or a Place. Optional. |
| stopover optional | Type:  boolean optional Default: true If true, indicates that this waypoint is a stop between the origin and destination. This has the effect of splitting the route into two legs. If false, indicates that the route should be biased to go through this waypoint, but not split into two legs. This is useful if you want to create a route in response to the user dragging waypoints on a map. |

DirectionsGeocodedWaypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/directions#DirectionsGeocodedWaypoint]
interface

google.maps.DirectionsGeocodedWaypoint
interface

A single geocoded waypoint.
| Properties |

DirectionsRoute [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/directions#DirectionsRoute]
interface

google.maps.DirectionsRoute
interface

A single route containing a set of legs in a DirectionsResult [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/directions#DirectionsResult]. Note that though this object is "JSON-like," it is not strictly JSON, as it directly and indirectly includes LatLng objects.
| Properties |
| --- |
| bounds | Type:  LatLngBounds The bounds for this route. |
| copyrights | Type:  string Copyrights text to be displayed for this route. |
| legs | Type:  Array<DirectionsLeg> An array of DirectionsLegs, each of which contains information about the steps of which it is composed. There will be one leg for each stopover waypoint or destination specified. So a route with no stopover waypoints will contain one DirectionsLeg and a route with one stopover waypoint will contain two. |
| overview_path | Type:  Array<LatLng> An array of LatLngs representing the entire course of this route. The path is simplified in order to make it suitable in contexts where a small number of vertices is required (such as Static Maps API URLs). |
| overview_polyline | Type:  string An encoded polyline representation of the route in overview_path. This polyline is an approximate (smoothed) path of the resulting directions. |
| summary | Type:  string Contains a short textual description for the route, suitable for naming and disambiguating the route from alternatives. |
| warnings | Type:  Array<string> Warnings to be displayed when showing these directions. |
| waypoint_order | Type:  Array<number> If optimizeWaypoints was set to true, this field will contain the re-ordered permutation of the input waypoints. For example, if the input was:   Origin: Los Angeles   Waypoints: Dallas, Bangor, Phoenix   Destination: New York and the optimized output was ordered as follows:   Origin: Los Angeles   Waypoints: Phoenix, Dallas, Bangor   Destination: New York then this field will be an Array containing the values [2, 0, 1]. Note that the numbering of waypoints is zero-based. If any of the input waypoints has stopover set to false, this field will be empty, since route optimization is not available for such queries. |
| fare optional | Type:  TransitFare optional The total fare for the whole transit trip. Only applicable to transit requests. |

DirectionsLeg [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/directions#DirectionsLeg]
interface

google.maps.DirectionsLeg
interface

A single leg consisting of a set of steps in a DirectionsResult [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.59/directions#DirectionsResult]. Some fields in the leg may not be returned for all requests. Note that though this result is "JSON-like," it is not strictly JSON, as it directly and indirectly includes LatLng objects.
| Properties |
| --- |
| end_address | Type:  string The address of the destination of this leg. This content is meant to be read as-is. Do not programmatically parse the formatted address. |
| end_location | Type:  LatLng The DirectionsService calculates directions between locations by using the nearest transportation option (usually a road) at the start and end locations. end_location indicates the actual geocoded destination, which may be different than the end_location of the last step if, for example, the road is not near the destination of this leg. |
| start_address | Type:  string The address of the origin of this leg. This content is meant to be read as-is. Do not programmatically parse the formatted address. |
| start_location | Type:  LatLng The DirectionsService calculates directions between locations by using the nearest transportation option (usually a road) at the start and end locations. start_location indicates the actual geocoded origin, which may be different than the start_location of the first step if, for example, the road is not near the origin of this leg. |
| steps | Type:  Array<DirectionsStep> An array of DirectionsSteps, each of which contains information about the individual steps in this leg. |
| traffic_speed_entry | Deprecated: This array will always be empty. Type:  Array<?> Information about traffic speed along the leg. |
| via_waypoints | Type:  Array<LatLng> An array of non-stopover waypoints along this leg, which were specified in the original request. Deprecated in alternative routes. Version 3.27 will be the last version of the API that adds extra via_waypoints in alternative routes. When using the Directions Service to implement draggable directions, it is recommended to disable dragging of alternative routes. Only the main route should be draggable. Users can drag the main route until it matches an alternative route. |
| arrival_time optional | Type:  Time optional An estimated arrival time for this leg. Only applicable for TRANSIT requests. |
| departure_time optional | Type:  Time optional An estimated departure time for this leg. Only applicable for TRANSIT requests. |
| distance optional | Type:  Distance optional The total distance covered by this leg. This property may be undefined as the distance may be unknown. |
| duration optional | Type:  Duration optional The total duration of this leg. This property may be undefined as the duration may be unknown. |

| end_location | Type:  LatLng The ending location of this step. |
| end_point | Deprecated: Please use DirectionsStep.end_location. Type:  LatLng The ending location of this step. |
| instructions | Type:  string Instructions for this step. |

interface

google.maps.Place
interface

| Properties |
| --- |
| location optional | Type:  LatLng\|LatLngLiteral optional The LatLng of the entity described by this place. |
| placeId optional | Type:  string optional The place ID of the place (such as a business or point of interest). The place ID is a unique identifier of a place in the Google Maps database. Note that the placeId is the most accurate way of identifying a place. If possible, you should specify the placeId rather than a query. A place ID can be retrieved from any request to the Places API, such as a TextSearch. Place IDs can also be retrieved from requests to the Geocoding API. For more information, see the overview of place IDs. |
| query optional | Type:  string optional A search query describing the place (such as a business or point of interest). An example query is "Quay, Upper Level, Overseas Passenger Terminal 5 Hickson Road, The Rocks NSW". If possible, you should specify the placeId rather than a query.
