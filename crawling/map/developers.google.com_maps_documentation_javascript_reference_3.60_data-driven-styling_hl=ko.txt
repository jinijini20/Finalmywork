FeatureLayer [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureLayer]
interface

google.maps.FeatureLayer
interface

An interface representing a map layer containing features of a specific FeatureType [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureType] whose style can be overridden client-side, or have events attached.
| Properties |
| --- |
| featureType | Type:  FeatureType The FeatureType associated with this FeatureLayer. |
| isAvailable | Type:  boolean Whether this FeatureLayer is available, meaning whether Data-driven styling is available for this map (there is a map ID using vector tiles with this FeatureLayer enabled in the Google Cloud Console map style.) If this is false (or becomes false), styling on this FeatureLayer returns to default and events are not triggered. |
| datasetId optional | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  string optional The Dataset ID for this FeatureLayer. Only present if the featureType is FeatureType.DATASET. |
| style optional | Type:  FeatureStyleOptions\|FeatureStyleFunction optional The style of Features in the FeatureLayer. The style is applied when style is set. If your style function updates, you must set the style property again. A FeatureStyleFunction must return consistent results when it is applied over the map tiles, and should be optimized for performance. Asynchronous functions are not supported. If you use a FeatureStyleOptions, all features of that layer will be styled with the same FeatureStyleOptions. Set the style to null to remove the previously set style. If this FeatureLayer is not available, setting style does nothing and logs an error. |
| Methods |
| --- |
| addListener | addListener(eventName, handler) Parameters:  eventName:  string Observed event. handler:  Function Function to handle events. Return Value:  MapsEventListener Resulting event listener. Adds the given listener function to the given event name. Returns an identifier for this listener that can be used with event.removeListener. |
| Events |
| --- |
| click | function(event) Arguments:  event:  FeatureMouseEvent This event is fired when the FeatureLayer is clicked. |
| mousemove | function(event) Arguments:  event:  FeatureMouseEvent This event is fired when the user's mouse moves over the FeatureLayer. |

FeatureType [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureType]
constants

google.maps.FeatureType
constants

Identifiers for feature types.
Access by calling const {FeatureType} = await google.maps.importLibrary("maps"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |
| --- |
| ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA_LEVEL_1 | Indicates a first-order civil entity below the country level. |
| ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA_LEVEL_2 | Indicates a second-order civil entity below the country level. |
| COUNTRY | Indicates the national political entity. |
| DATASET | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Indicates a third-party dataset. |
| LOCALITY | Indicates an incorporated city or town political entity. |
| POSTAL_CODE | Indicates a postal code as used to address postal mail within the country. Includes zip codes. |
| SCHOOL_DISTRICT | Indicates a school district. |

FeatureStyleFunction [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureStyleFunction]
typedef

google.maps.FeatureStyleFunction
typedef

A function to style a FeatureLayer.

google.maps.FeatureStyleFunctionOptions
interface

Options passed to a FeatureStyleFunction.
| Properties |
| --- |
| feature | Type:  Feature Feature passed into the FeatureStyleFunction for styling. |

FeatureStyleOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureStyleOptions]
interface

google.maps.FeatureStyleOptions
interface

These options specify the way the style of a Feature should be modified on a map.
| Properties |
| --- |
| fillColor optional | Type:  string optional Hex RGB string (like "#00FF00" for green). Only applies to polygon geometries. |
| fillOpacity optional | Type:  number optional The fill opacity between 0.0 and 1.0. Only applies to polygon geometries. |
| strokeColor optional | Type:  string optional Hex RGB string (like "#00FF00" for green). |
| strokeOpacity optional | Type:  number optional The stroke opacity between 0.0 and 1.0. Only applies to line and polygon geometries. |
| strokeWeight optional | Type:  number optional The stroke width in pixels. Only applies to line and polygon geometries. |

Feature [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#Feature]
interface

google.maps.Feature
interface

An interface representing a vector map tile feature. These are inputs to the FeatureStyleFunction. Do not save a reference to a particular Feature object because the reference will not be stable.
| Properties |
| --- |
| featureType | Type:  FeatureType FeatureType of this Feature. |

PlaceFeature [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#PlaceFeature]
interface

google.maps.PlaceFeature
interface

An interface representing a feature with a place ID which includes features of type FeatureType.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA_LEVEL_1 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureType.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA_LEVEL_1], FeatureType.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA_LEVEL_2 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureType.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA_LEVEL_2], FeatureType.COUNTRY [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureType.COUNTRY], FeatureType.LOCALITY [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureType.LOCALITY], FeatureType.POSTAL_CODE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureType.POSTAL_CODE], and FeatureType.SCHOOL_DISTRICT [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#FeatureType.SCHOOL_DISTRICT].
This interface extends
Feature [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/data-driven-styling#Feature].

| Properties |
| --- |
| placeId | Type:  string The PlaceResult.place_id. |
| Inherited: featureType |
| Methods |
| --- |
| fetchPlace | fetchPlace() Parameters:  None Return Value:  Promise<Place> Fetches a Place for this PlaceFeature. In the resulting Place object, the id and the displayName properties will be populated. The display name will be in the language the end user sees on the map. (Additional fields can be subsequently requested via Place.fetchFields() subject to normal Places API enablement and billing.) Do not call this from a FeatureStyleFunction since only synchronous FeatureStyleFunctions are supported. The promise is rejected if there was an error fetching the Place. |

interface

google.maps.DatasetFeature
interface

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
