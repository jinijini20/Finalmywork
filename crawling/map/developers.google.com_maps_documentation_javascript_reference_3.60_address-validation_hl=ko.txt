| previousResponseId optional | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  string optional This field must not be set for the first address validation request.

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
Details of the post-processed address. Post-processing includes correcting misspelled parts of the address, replacing incorrect parts, and inferring missing parts.
Access by calling const {Address} = await google.maps.importLibrary("addressValidation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Properties |
| --- |

| formattedAddress | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  string optional The post-processed address, formatted as a single-line address following the address-formatting rules of the region where the address is located. |
| missingComponentTypes | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  Array<string> The types of components that were expected to be present in a correctly formatted mailing address but were not found in the input AND could not be inferred. Components of this type are not present in formatted_address, postal_address, or address_components. An example might be ['street_number', 'route'] for an input like "Boulder, Colorado, 80301, USA". The list of possible types can be found here. |

| unconfirmedComponentTypes | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  Array<string> The types of the components that are present in the address_components but could not be confirmed to be correct. This field is provided for the sake of convenience: its contents are equivalent to iterating through the address_components to find the types of all the components where the AddressComponent.confirmationLevel is not ConfirmationLevel.CONFIRMED or the AddressComponent.inferred flag is not set to true. The list of possible types can be found here. |
| unresolvedTokens | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  Array<string> Any tokens in the input that could not be resolved. This might be an input that was not recognized as a valid part of an address (for example in an input like "123235253253 Main St, San Francisco, CA, 94105", the unresolved tokens may look like ["123235253253"] since that does not look like a valid street number. |

AddressComponent [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/address-validation#AddressComponent]
class

google.maps.addressValidation.AddressComponent
class

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].

| replaced | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  boolean Indicates the name of the component was replaced with a completely different one. For example, replacing a wrong postal code being with one that is correct for the address. This is not a cosmetic change; the input component has been changed to a different one. |
| spellCorrected | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  boolean Indicates a correction to a misspelling in the component name. The API does not always flag changes from one spelling variant to another, such as "centre" to "center". |
| unexpected | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  boolean If true, this component is not expected to be present in a postal address for the given region. It has been retained only because it was part of the input. |

| featureSizeMeters | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  number optional The size of the geocoded place, in meters. This is another measure of the coarseness of the geocoded location, but in physical size rather than in semantic meaning. |
| location | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  LatLngAltitude optional The geocoded location of the input. |
| placeId | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  string optional The Place ID of the geocoded place. Using Place is preferred over using addresses, latitude/longitude coordinates, or plus codes. Using coordinates for routing or calculating driving directions will always result in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates. This may not be a road that will quickly or safely lead to the destination and may not be near an access point to the property. Additionally, when a location is reverse geocoded, there is no guarantee that the returned address will match the original. |
| placeTypes | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  Array<string> The type(s) of place that the input geocoded to. For example, ['locality', 'political']. The full list of types can be found in the Geocoding API documentation. |

Granularity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/address-validation#Granularity]
constants

google.maps.addressValidation.Granularity
constants

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
The various granularities that an address or a geocode can have. When used to indicate granularity for an address, these values indicate with how fine a granularity the address identifies a mailing destination. For example, an address such as "123 Main Street, Redwood City, CA, 94061" identifies a PREMISE while something like "Redwood City, CA, 94061" identifies a LOCALITY. However, if we are unable to find a geocode for "123 Main Street" in Redwood City, the geocode returned might be of LOCALITY granularity even though the address is more granular.
Access by calling const {Granularity} = await google.maps.importLibrary("addressValidation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |
| --- |
| BLOCK | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. The address or geocode indicates a block. Only used in regions which have block-level addressing, such as Japan. |
