AutocompleteSuggestion [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/autocomplete-data#AutocompleteSuggestion]
class

google.maps.places.AutocompleteSuggestion
class

An Autocomplete suggestion result.
Access by calling const {AutocompleteSuggestion} = await google.maps.importLibrary("places"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Static Methods |
| --- |
| fetchAutocompleteSuggestions | fetchAutocompleteSuggestions(autocompleteRequest) Parameters:  autocompleteRequest:  AutocompleteRequest Return Value:  Promise<{suggestions:Array<AutocompleteSuggestion>}> Fetches a list of AutocompleteSuggestions.  If a AutocompleteRequest.sessionToken is provided in the request, then that session token will automatically be included when calling Place.fetchFields for the first time, on each Place returned by PlacePrediction.toPlace on the resulting PlacePredictions. |
| Properties |
| --- |
| placePrediction | Type:  PlacePrediction optional Contains the human-readable name for the returned result. For establishment results, this is usually the business name and address.  If a AutocompleteRequest.sessionToken was provided in the AutocompleteRequest used to fetch this AutocompleteSuggestion, the same token will automatically be included when calling Place.fetchFields for the first time on the Place returned by a call to PlacePrediction.toPlace. |

AutocompleteRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/autocomplete-data#AutocompleteRequest]
interface

google.maps.places.AutocompleteRequest
interface

Request interface for AutocompleteSuggestion.fetchAutocompleteSuggestions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/autocomplete-data#AutocompleteSuggestion.fetchAutocompleteSuggestions].
| Properties |
| --- |
| input | Type:  string The text string on which to search. |
| includedPrimaryTypes optional | Type:  Array<string> optional Included primary Place type (for example, "restaurant" or "gas_station").  A Place is only returned if its primary type is included in this list. Up to 5 values can be specified. If no types are specified, all Place types are returned. |
| includedRegionCodes optional | Type:  Array<string> optional Only include results in the specified regions, specified as up to 15 CLDR two-character region codes. An empty set will not restrict the results. If both locationRestriction and includedRegionCodes are set, the results will be located in the area of intersection. |
| inputOffset optional | Type:  number optional A zero-based Unicode character offset of input indicating the cursor position in input. The cursor position may influence what predictions are returned. If not specified, defaults to the length of input. |
| language optional | Type:  string optional The language in which to return results. Will default to the browser's language preference. The results may be in mixed languages if the language used in input is different from language, or if the returned Place does not have a translation from the local language to language. |
| locationBias optional | Type:  LocationBias optional Bias results to a specified location.  At most one of locationBias or locationRestriction should be set. If neither are set, the results will be biased by IP address, meaning the IP address will be mapped to an imprecise location and used as a biasing signal. |
| locationRestriction optional | Type:  LocationRestriction optional Restrict results to a specified location.  At most one of locationBias or locationRestriction should be set. If neither are set, the results will be biased by IP address, meaning the IP address will be mapped to an imprecise location and used as a biasing signal. |
| origin optional | Type:  LatLng\|LatLngLiteral optional The origin point from which to calculate geodesic distance to the destination (returned as PlacePrediction.distanceMeters). If this value is omitted, geodesic distance will not be returned. |
| region optional | Type:  string optional The region code, specified as a CLDR two-character region code. This affects address formatting, result ranking, and may influence what results are returned. This does not restrict results to the specified region. |
| sessionToken optional | Type:  AutocompleteSessionToken optional A token which identifies an Autocomplete session for billing purposes. Generate a new session token via AutocompleteSessionToken.  The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and concludes when they select a place and call Place.fetchFields. Each session can have multiple queries, followed by one fetchFields call. The credentials used for each request within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If the sessionToken parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed separately).  When a session token is provided in the request to AutocompleteSuggestion.fetchAutocompleteSuggestions, the same token will automatically be included in the first call to fetchFields on a Place returned by calling PlacePrediction.toPlace on one of the resulting AutocompleteSuggestions.  We recommend the following guidelines: Use session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls. Generate a fresh token for each session. Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session. Using the same token for more than one session will result in each request being billed individually. |

AutocompleteSessionToken [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/autocomplete-data#AutocompleteSessionToken]
class

google.maps.places.AutocompleteSessionToken
class

Represents a session token used for tracking an autocomplete session.
Access by calling const {AutocompleteSessionToken} = await google.maps.importLibrary("places"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constructor |
| --- |
| AutocompleteSessionToken | AutocompleteSessionToken() Parameters:  None Creates a new instance of AutocompleteSessionToken. |

PlacePrediction [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/autocomplete-data#PlacePrediction]
class

google.maps.places.PlacePrediction
class

Prediction results for a Place Autocomplete prediction.
Access by calling const {PlacePrediction} = await google.maps.importLibrary("places"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Properties |
| --- |
| distanceMeters | Type:  number optional The length of the geodesic in meters from origin if origin is specified. |
| mainText | Type:  FormattableText optional Represents the name of the Place. |
| placeId | Type:  string The unique identifier of the suggested Place. This identifier can be used in other APIs that accept Place IDs. |
| secondaryText | Type:  FormattableText optional Represents additional disambiguating features (such as a city or region) to further identify the Place. |
| text | Type:  FormattableText Contains the human-readable name for the returned result. For establishment results, this is usually the business name and address.  text is recommended for developers who wish to show a single UI element. Developers who wish to show two separate, but related, UI elements may want to use PlacePrediction.mainText and PlacePrediction.secondaryText instead. |
| types | Type:  Array<string> List of types that apply to this Place from Table A or Table B in https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types. |
| Methods |
| --- |
| fetchAddressValidation | Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. fetchAddressValidation(request) Parameters:  request:  AddressValidationRequest Return Value:  None Sends an Address Validation request associated with this autocomplete session (internally populating the request with the autocomplete session token). No place information from the PlacePrediction is included automatically - this is a convenience method to help with autocomplete session management. |
| toPlace | toPlace() Parameters:  None Return Value:  Place Returns a Place representation of this PlacePrediction. A subsequent call to Place.fetchFields is required to get full Place details.  If a AutocompleteRequest.sessionToken was provided in the AutocompleteRequest used to fetch this PlacePrediction, the same token will automatically be included when calling fetchFields.  Alternatively, when using PlaceAutocompleteElement the first call to Place.fetchFields on a Place returned by PlacePrediction.toPlace will automatically include the session token. |

StringRange [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/autocomplete-data#StringRange]
class

google.maps.places.StringRange
class

Identifies a substring within a given text.
Access by calling const {StringRange} = await google.maps.importLibrary("places"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Properties |
| --- |
| endOffset | Type:  number Zero-based offset of the last Unicode character of the substring (exclusive). |
| startOffset | Type:  number Zero-based offset of the first Unicode character of the substring (inclusive). |

FormattableText [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.60/autocomplete-data#FormattableText]
class

google.maps.places.FormattableText
class

Text representing a Place prediction. The text may be used as is or formatted.
Access by calling const {FormattableText} = await google.maps.importLibrary("places"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Properties |
| --- |
| matches | Type:  Array<StringRange> A list of string ranges identifying where the input request matched in FormattableText.text. The ranges can be used to format specific parts of text. The substrings may not be exact matches of AutocompleteRequest.input if the matching was determined by criteria other than string matching (for example, spell corrections or transliterations). These values are Unicode character offsets of FormattableText.text. The ranges are guaranteed to be ordered in increasing offset values. |
| text | Type:  string Text that may be used as is or formatted with FormattableText.matches. |
